# Core Flight System : Framework : App : Command Ingest Lab

This repository contains NASA's Command Ingest Lab (ci_lab), which is a framework component of the Core Flight System.

This lab application is a non-flight utility to send commands to the cFS Bundle. It is intended to be located in the `apps/ci_lab` subdirectory of a cFS Mission Tree.  The Core Flight System is bundled at https://github.com/nasa/cFS (which includes ci_lab as a submodule), which includes build and execution instructions.

ci_lab is a simple command uplink application that accepts CCSDS telecommand packets over a UDP/IP port. It does not provide a full CCSDS Telecommand stack implementation.

## Release Notes

ci_lab version 2.2.0a is released as part of cFE 6.6.0a under the Apache 2.0 license, see [LICENSE](LICENSE-18128-Apache-2_0.pdf).

Note the old GSFC Build toolset is deprecated (fsw/for_build/Makefile) in favor of cmake (CMakeLists.txt)

## Known issues

Dependence on cfe platform config header is undesirable, and the check is not endian safe.  As a lab application, extensive testing is not performed prior to release and only minimal functionality is included.
